GPT responded this transformation :
const transformationMatrix = new Float32Array([
        0.4330127, -0.25, 0.25, 0.15,
        0.25, 0.4330127, -0.4330127, -0.125,
        -0.25, 0.25, 0.4330127, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 1
    ]);

My transformation looks like this: 

const targetMatrix = new Float32Array([
        0.1767766922712326, -0.3061862071122423, 0.3535533845424652, 0.12957956156677275,

        0.1268264870081648, 0.780330057776724, 0.6123724142244846, -0.15703456682984201,

In the task of calculating a transformation matrix for a 3D object, the specified order of transformations was scaling, followed by rotation, and finally translation. This order is critical in 3D transformations as it defines how the object is manipulated in space. The desired mathematical expression for this sequence of transformations, following the 
p
′
=
T
(
R
(
S
p
)
)
p 
′
 =T(R(Sp)) rule, is to first apply scaling (S), then rotation (R), and lastly translation (T).

However, in the responses provided, there was an inconsistency in following this specified order. The initial response incorrectly applied the transformations in the sequence of translation, scaling, then rotation. Furthermore, the order of matrix multiplication did not align with the 
p
′
=
T
(
R
(
S
p
)
)
p 
′
 =T(R(Sp)) rule, which dictates that the first transformation in sequence (scaling in this case) should be closest to the point/vector 
p
p in the multiplication chain.

To correctly apply the transformations in the order of scaling, rotation, and translation, the matrix multiplication should be conducted as follows:

Multiply the point/vector with the scaling matrix: 
S
p
Sp.
Multiply the result with the rotation matrix: 
R
(
S
p
)
R(Sp).
Finally, multiply that result with the translation matrix: 
T
(
R
(
S
p
)
)
T(R(Sp)).
In JavaScript, this multiplication sequence should be executed in reverse order due to the nature of matrix operations in programming. It means that the last transformation matrix (translation in this case) should be on the leftmost side of the multiplication chain, and the first transformation matrix (scaling) should be on the rightmost side.

For animating I need to give an identity matrix to make GPT understand the initial position. T tried so much to make it give the correct answer directly however it was just doing some part correct some part wrong in each response. So I manage to build it the animation from the parts of bunch of responses.
